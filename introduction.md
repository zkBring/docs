# Introduction

## Introducing zkBring
zkBring is a platform on Base that offers private, secure, and user-friendly crypto airdrops. By leveraging zkTLS technology (powered by zkPass), zkBring enables genuine user engagement while preventing bots or fake accounts—all without exposing personal data. Our mission is to create frictionless airdrop experiences that reach a broader audience beyond the crypto niche.

## Key Concepts & Terminology
- **zkTLS (Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security):**  
  A protocol that connects any website’s data to the blockchain using privacy-preserving proofs computed on a user’s device.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):**  
  Cryptographic proofs that allow users to demonstrate eligibility for an airdrop without revealing private information.

- **Webproofs:**  
  Locally generated proofs confirming your online activity or membership status without storing or transmitting personal data.

- **Base Chain:**  
  A fast, low-cost Layer-2 blockchain utilized by zkBring for secure on-chain operations.

- **zkPass:**  
  The service provider behind zkTLS, ensuring private, zero-knowledge verification of user data.

## about zkTLS
zkTLS leverages the power of zero-knowledge proofs to secure user data while connecting web activities with blockchain transactions. This method verifies that you qualify for an airdrop without compromising your personal details, safeguarding privacy throughout the process.

## zkTLS airdrops
zkTLS airdrops use these privacy-preserving techniques to distribute tokens fairly. By verifying user eligibility and online actions through zero-knowledge proofs, these airdrops:
- Ensure real user engagement over bot activity.
- Enable creative campaigns using any website’s data.
- Provide crypto projects with access to a mainstream, verified user base.
